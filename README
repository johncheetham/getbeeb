GetBeeb 0.1.4
John Cheetham October 2008

Project Homepage : http://www.johncheetham.com/projects/getbeeb

Description
-----------
Processes XML feeds from the BBC and creates HTML files containing links to the
realaudio files. It is licensed under the GPL (see the file named COPYING).

Running
-------
To run it use the 'run' shell script.

The list of URLs for the XML feeds is contained in the file 'filelist'.

Options can be configured in the 'getbeeb.properties' file.

Set 'getAllLinks=false' to generate links to the 'Media Selectors' rather than
to the realaudio file itself. This runs much quicker since it only requires one
connection to get the XML feed itself. The link will point to the getbeeb.pl
perl cgi program so to use this option you need a perl enabled webserver with 
the getbeeb.pl program in the cgi-bin. This is the default and you can see
generated pages at
http://www.johncheetham.com/projects/getbeeb/pdahome.html.

Set 'getAllLinks=true' to generate links to the actual realaudio file (.ram file).
This requires making a connection to the BBC for every programme and the runtime 
will be much longer. It produces standalone html files that don't need a
webserver.

Set the 'sleep' option to control how long (in seconds) the program waits
in between connections.
